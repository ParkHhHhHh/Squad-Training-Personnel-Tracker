## 🌟 Overview

This project explores how **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** can be used to design  
an effective training schedule for a small military squad.  

The idea comes from my experience as a **delegated squad leader in Korean military bootcamp**,  
where I had to balance:

- 🏃 Physical training  
- 🎯 Shooting accuracy  
- 🧭 Tactical exercises  
- 😴 Rest & recovery  

The project demonstrates how real-world decision-making can be translated into  
a **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** and solved through **Q-learning**.
